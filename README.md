# 🔥 Ignite Playground

A comprehensive workspace for learning, practicing, and mastering Apache Ignite - the distributed database, caching, and computing platform.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as my personal playground for:

- Learning Apache Ignite concepts, architecture, and best practices
- Practicing implementation of distributed computing patterns
- Exploring Ignite's capabilities for real-time data processing
- Documenting enterprise-grade implementation approaches
- Collecting valuable resources encountered during the learning journey

## 💡 Projects & Experiments

Each experiment or mini-project is organized in its own directory with clear documentation:

1. **basic-cluster-setup/** - Basic configuration for a multi-node Ignite cluster
2. **cache-patterns/** - Different caching strategies and their performance characteristics
3. **sql-queries/** - Working with Ignite's SQL capabilities and optimizations
4. **compute-grid/** - Examples of distributed computing tasks
5. **streaming/** - Real-time data processing with Ignite
