# 🔥 Ignite Playground

A comprehensive workspace for learning, practicing, and mastering Apache Ignite - the distributed database, caching, and computing platform.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as my personal playground for:

- Learning Apache Ignite concepts, architecture, and best practices
- Practicing implementation of distributed computing patterns
- Exploring Ignite's capabilities for real-time data processing
- Documenting enterprise-grade implementation approaches
- Collecting valuable resources encountered during the learning journey
